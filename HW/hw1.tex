\begin{problem}[Exercise 1.2]
The error comes from the third line of the proof, where
the author divides both sides of the equality by $(x-y)$.
This is illegal because $x-y = 0$.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}[Exercise 1.3]
\begin{enumerate}
	\item No. The number of squares on the board would be $m\times n$,
	      which would be odd. However, to perfectly cover
	      the board, one needs an even number of square.
	\item Yes. An example of that would be to vertically tile the board.
\end{enumerate}
