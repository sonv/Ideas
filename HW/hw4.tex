Do Problem 1 below AND the problems from the book
\begin{problem}
In class on Oct 8, we discussed about inflation and present value.
In short, if someone gives you $F$ amount of dollars every year
and the inflation rate is $r$, then the present value of $N$ year
of this fixed income would be
\begin{equation*}
	PV = F + \frac{F}{1 + r} + \dots + \frac{F}{(1 + r)^N} \,.
\end{equation*}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Use induction to prove that after $N$ year,
	      \begin{equation*}
		      PV = F \left(\frac{ 1 + r - \frac{1}{(1+r)^{N}} }{r} \right)
	      \end{equation*}
	\item Apply this to the situation when $F = \$1$ and $r = 5\%$ (I made a mistake in
	      class about this)
	\item What happen if you were to live forever? How much would you buy a stock if
	      it pays you $\$1$ per year from now to eternity?
\end{enumerate}
