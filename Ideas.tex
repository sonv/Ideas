\end{itemize}

There are a few books that I highly recommend if you are motivated.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \href{https://infinitedescent.xyz/}{\emph{Infinite Descent}} by Newstead. This book was written
  by my pal Clive Newstead for a course similar to Math 170 (but slightly more demanding and standardized) and it was an instant hit at Carnegie Mellon University.
\item
  \href{https://www.amazon.com/Mathematics-Elementary-Approach-Ideas-Methods/dp/0195105192}{\emph{What is mathematics?}} by Courant, Robbins and Stewart. This is a classic written
  by two giants in modern mathematics.
  It was written to help teachers and students ``look beyond mathematical formalism and manipulation and to grasp
  the real essence of mathematics.''
\item
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org}{\emph{Wikipedia}}. In my opinion, this is the best source
  to learn about basic concepts in general (not just mathematics) if you know what
  you are looking for.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{course-description}{%
\subsection*{Course description}\label{course-description}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Course description}

This course, if successful, will help students explore how to read and write mathematics.
At its best, mathematics contains all of the following: creativity, beauty and, of course, precision.
A masterpiece in mathematics could be compared to a great drawing or a classic novel.
As an example, Martin Hairer's \href{https://www.quantamagazine.org/hearing-music-in-noise-martin-hairer-wins-the-fields-medal-20140812}{\emph{regularity structure}} is compared to \emph{Lord of the Rings}
on Quanta Magazine.

We will start with the basic language of modern mathematics, logic and set theory.
Then, depending on the interests of students, we will talk about some (but not limited to) of the following topics: infinity, number theory, combinatorics, probability, game theory,
linear algebra, discrete and/or differential dynamical systems.
Along the way, we will find real world applications of the above subjects.

\hypertarget{learning-objectives}{%
\subsection*{Learning objectives}\label{learning-objectives}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Learning objectives}

Two things:
- I hope this course will help you have fun and nerdy conversations with friends (or strangers on the bus), whether they're math people or not.
At the least, if you don't like the awkward silence, strike a conversation about \(\infty\)!
- I hope you will find beauty in mathematics by knowing that mathematics is all about ideas,
not computations (although computations play a big part in the usefulness of mathematics).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  You can choose to collaborate with at most one more person as a team. If you do so,
  please turn in just one work and write down names of two on the top.
\item
  Homework must be turned in \textbf{by the beginning of the class} on the due date.
\item
  All homework must be turned in via paper but you need to submit a scanned version to Canvas for proof of submission.
\item
  Collaboration for homework is strongly encouraged but you \textbf{MUST} write up your own work. Word-to-word copying is plagiarism.
\item
  Generously credit all of the people who you collaborate with at the beginning of your work.
\item
  If you use outside sources (internet, books, friends, etc.) for a particular problem, acknowledge them at the beginning of the problem.
  You will \textbf{NOT} be penalized for consulting outside sources as long as you credit them.
\item
  \textbf{Late homework policy:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Late homework will NOT be accpeted. However, the two worst homeworks will be dropped.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Advice:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Eat well and get enough sleep.
  \item
    Start early. One problem per day is more pleasant than seven problems in one night.
  \item
    Try to understand the materials rather than rote memorization. This will show in exams.
  \item
    Try to write clearly and demonstrate clarity of thoughts.

On average, you should expect to be roughly 3 hours in class per week, which are included in a total of 10 working hours per course per week. If you are finding it difficult to complete your work in time, please come talk to me ASAP so that we can diagnose the issue and adjust accordingly. If something is not working for you, please do not hesitate to raise it in one of the feedback sessions or come see me outside of class.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Academic Dishonesty}

As Fulbright University's Code of Academic Integrity explains: ``plagiarism occurs when a writer appropriates another's ideas, research, or writing without proper acknowledgement of the source or uses another's words without the use of quotation marks, whether intentional or not.'' All Fulbright students are responsible for familiarizing themselves with the Code of Academic Integrity.

\hypertarget{learning-support}{%
\subsection*{Learning Support}\label{learning-support}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Learning Support}

Please remember that ``Help is always available at FUV, if you just reach out!''. There are ample resources available to help you survive and thrive on your academic journey. The Fulbright Learning Support team can provide you with guidance in the following areas:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Academic skills (e.g., Reading, Writing, Listening, Speaking and Presentation)
\item
  Study skills (e.g., Time management, Planning your Assignments, Task Management, Note-taking Skills)\\
\item
  Research-related skills (e.g., Selecting Peer-reviewed Journals, Qualitative Coding, Planning a Research Project)
\item
  Exam strategies \& Test-taking skills\\
\item
  Academic Integrity (e.g., Avoiding Plagiarism, Paraphrasing Skills, Citing and Referencing)
\item
  Individual Learning Plan (i.e., Brainstorming, Planning, Prioritizing, Monitoring, Reflection on Learning)
\item
  Making use of the Work-in-Progress Learning Guides for independently learning fundamental academic skills and study skills
\item
  Discipline-related content (e.g., Arts, History, Vietnam Studies)
\end{itemize}

Support for these areas includes Workshops, Skill Practice Sessions and Group Advising Sessions organized during the semesters, and you can also refer to the Study Skills \& Academic Skills 101 canvas module. Additionally, if you would like to have one-on-one advising/ mentoring sessions to discuss your specific academic concerns (e.g., how to improve your thesis statement, how to `polish' your academic writing style, identify your strengths and weaknesses in your academic reading skills), you can book an appointment with a learning support staff member or with a peer mentor via the booking link.\\
If you have further questions about learning support, please send an email to \href{mailto:learning.support@fulbright.edu.vn}{\nolinkurl{learning.support@fulbright.edu.vn}}
